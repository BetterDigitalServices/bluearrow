1. Definitions
"Font Software" means coded software that is accompanied by this Agreement or that You have ordered online and that generates typeface designs when used with the appropriate hard- and software, plus any and all other data including documentation provided with such software.

 "Licensed Unit" means installations of the Font Software that allow the design of Your Websites which have - based on any six consecutive calendar months - not more than the overall monthly average of Pageviews stated on Your invoice for the purchase of the Font Software. If no number of Pageviews is given on your invoice, the licensed number of Pageviews is 500,000 per month. If Your Websites averages (based on a period of six consecutive calendar months) at any given time in the future more than the licensed number of Pageviews per month, You must purchase an extended licence from Storm Type or its authorized distributors.

"Use" means to design Your own personal or business Website with the typeface embodied in the Font Software and to make accessible the Font Software together with Your Website on a web server in order to enable a web browser to render the content of such a Website using the respective Font Software. Use does not include the behaviour set forth in Clause 2.2. below.

"Website" as used here is a connected group of related web pages which form an entity whose content is managed by You, and which are organized under a particular domain name, including sub-domains. The Website can be viewed either over Your local area network or over the Internet. For the avoidance of doubt, web pages on sub-domains whose content is managed by other persons are deemed to be not part of Your Website.

"Pageview" is each request to load a single page of each of Your Websites. Pageviews - also referred to as page impressions or page requests - must be recorded by a commonly accepted or recognized performance tracking system. Storm Type reserves the right to request written copies of your average Pageview reporting statistics.
