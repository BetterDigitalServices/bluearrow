Draft up revisions or variations of live, published content. Publish the drafted content manually or with the built-in scheduling system.


== Description ==

On a busy site you can't afford to make changes to *live*, *published* posts without reviewing and approving them first. **Revisionize** clones your post, page or CPT to a draft that gives you the freedom to tweak, edit and experiment with the content. Preview your drafted changes and/or [share the preview](https://wordpress.org/plugins/public-post-preview/) with a 3rd party to approve the changes. When you're happy, publish the revision, which will copy your content changes to the original post. Alternatively, schedule the revision to publish your content at a specific time.

2. Alternate way to Revisionize
3. A Revision. Save as many drafts as you wish. Preview the post to see how it looks. Or delete it if you don't want it. When the revision is published, it will overwrite its original. But don't worry, the original is saved as another revision (for a backup). 
4. Schedule multiple revisions/variations to be published consecutively. The URL of the post stays the same, the content will just update at the scheduled time. No redirects or messing around with slugs. 
5. The original post is kept around as a revision just in case you want to revert back to the way things were.

== Upgrade Notice ==
